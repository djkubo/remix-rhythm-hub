## Supabase + Edge Functions (ManyChat)

- This project uses Supabase Edge Functions:
  - `sync-manychat`: must be **public** so the website can call it (configured with `verify_jwt = false` in `supabase/config.toml`).
  - `setup-manychat`: admin-only (requires an authenticated admin token).
  - `stripe-checkout`: must be **public** so the website can redirect users to Stripe Checkout (configured with `verify_jwt = false` in `supabase/config.toml`).
    - Requires the Edge Function secret `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (never commit or expose this in the frontend).
  - `paypal-checkout`: must be **public** so the website can redirect users to PayPal (configured with `verify_jwt = false` in `supabase/config.toml`).
    - Requires the Edge Function secrets `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` (never commit or expose the secret in the frontend).
  - `process-email-queue`: background worker for transactional emails (payment confirmation, shipping updates) using Brevo.
    - Configure secrets: `BREVO_API_KEY` (recommended) or `BREVO_SMTP_KEY` (fallback), `BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL`, `BREVO_SENDER_NAME`, `EMAIL_WORKER_TOKEN`.
    - Run via scheduler/cron with header `x-email-worker-token: <EMAIL_WORKER_TOKEN>` and body `{"limit":25}`.
  - `shippo-webhook`: receives Shippo shipping events (`track_updated` / `transaction_updated`) and syncs lead shipping status.
    - Configure security secrets:
      - `SHIPPO_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` (required unless `SHIPPO_WEBHOOK_REQUIRE_AUTH=false`)
      - `SHIPPO_HMAC_SECRET` (optional but recommended for signature verification)
      - `SHIPPO_HMAC_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` (optional, default `600`)
    - Shippo webhook URL format:
      - `https://<YOUR_PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/functions/v1/shippo-webhook?token=<SHIPPO_WEBHOOK_TOKEN>`
    - Recommended Shippo events: `track_updated` (primary), `transaction_updated` (secondary fallback).
- After publishing/deploying, you can verify `sync-manychat` is public by opening:
  - `https://<YOUR_PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/functions/v1/sync-manychat`
  - Expected response: `{"ok":true,"function":"sync-manychat"}` (if you see `{"error":"Unauthorized"}`, the function is still deployed with JWT verification enabled).

- After publishing/deploying, you can verify `stripe-checkout` is public by opening:
  - `https://<YOUR_PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-checkout`
  - Expected response: `{"ok":true,"function":"stripe-checkout"}`.

- After publishing/deploying, you can verify `paypal-checkout` is public by opening:
  - `https://<YOUR_PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/functions/v1/paypal-checkout`
  - Expected response: `{"ok":true,"function":"paypal-checkout"}`.
